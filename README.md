# kaprekar
A C program that identifies and counts repeating numbers based on their digits. Users can specify the number of digits (between 4 to 9), and results are saved in an appropriate output file (like output4.txt).

# Number Repeater Detection Algorithm

This C program detects and counts numbers that reach a repeating cycle based on a specific algorithm. The algorithm works by:

1. Taking a number as input and checking its validity (allowing up to two repeated digits).
2. It rearranges the digits of the number in ascending and descending order.
3. The difference between the largest and smallest rearrangement is calculated.
4. This process is repeated until a repeating number is detected.

## Usage

- The constant `DIGITS` can be set to any value between **4** and **9**. 
- The program will generate an output file named `output{DIGITS}.txt`, where `{DIGITS}` corresponds to the value you set. For example, if `DIGITS` is set to `6`, the output file will be `output6.txt`.

Make sure to compile the program with a C compiler before running it. The results will be saved in the specified output file.

# 📘 Kaprekar Cycle Finder

## 📖 Introduction
This is a simple **Kaprekar Cycle Finder** implemented in **C++**.  
It finds the cycle generated by repeatedly applying the Kaprekar routine (sorting digits ascending/descending and subtracting) until the sequence falls into a repeating cycle.

- Works for any digit length (configurable).
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Input can be provided via **command-line argument** or **default value**.

---

## ⚙️ How it works
1. Start with an initial number (e.g., `3524`).
2. Sort digits descending → `5432`.
3. Sort digits ascending → `2345`.
4. Subtract: `5432 - 2345 = 3087`.
5. Repeat the process with result (`3087`).
6. Eventually, the sequence will **fall into a repeating cycle**.
7. Program detects the cycle and prints it.

## 🚀 How to Build & Run

### 🔹 Windows
1. Install **MinGW** or use **MSVC (Visual Studio Developer Tools)**.
2. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** in project folder.
3. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o kaprekar.exe
````

4. Run with argument:

   ```bash
   kaprekar.exe 3524
   ```

   Or without argument (uses default number defined in code):

   ```bash
   kaprekar.exe
   ```

---

### 🔹 macOS / Linux

1. Open terminal in project folder.
2. Compile:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o kaprekar
   ```
3. Run with argument:

   ```bash
   ./kaprekar 3524
   ```

   Or run with default number:

   ```bash
   ./kaprekar
   ```

---

## ✏️ Example Output

```
Start number: 3524
Step 1: 5432 - 2345 = 3087
Step 2: 8730 - 0378 = 8352
Step 3: 8532 - 2358 = 6174
Step 4: 7641 - 1467 = 6174
Reached a cycle! One of the cycle members: 6174
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

* Inside `main.cpp`, at the top you will see:

  ```cpp
  const int DIGITS = 4;   // Number of digits for Kaprekar routine
  ```

  Change this to any digit length (e.g., 3, 4, 6, etc.).

* Default starting number is also configurable in code:

  ```cpp
  string startNumber = "3524"; // Default if no argument is given
  ```

---

## 💡 Notes

* Works best with numbers that match `DIGITS` length (e.g., for `DIGITS = 4`, input `3524` not `352`).
* If you enter fewer digits, the program will **pad with zeros** automatically.
* If you enter more digits, extra digits are considered.

---

## 🖥️ Cross-platform Tested On:

* ✅ Windows 10 (MinGW g++)
* ✅ macOS (Apple clang++)
* ✅ Ubuntu Linux (g++)
